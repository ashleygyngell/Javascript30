      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      // team[3] = 'Lux';

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // IT IS NOT A COPY

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = 'yeeehawwww';
      console.log(team4);

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      console.log(team5);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      captain = person;
      captain.number = 99;
      console.log(captain);

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 123 });
      console.log(cap2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      const cap3 = { ...person };
      console.log(cap3);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
